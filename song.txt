Forgive me, Peter, my lost fearless leader
In closets like cedar, preserved from when we were just kids
Is it something I did?
The goddess of timing once found us beguiling
he said she was trying, Peter, was she lying? My ribs
Get the feeling she did
And I didn't wanna come down
I thought it was just goodbye for now
You said you were gonna grow up, then you were gonna come find me
Said you were gonna grow up, then you were gonna come find me
